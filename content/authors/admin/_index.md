Jack Kauphusman is a biologist in environmental consulting working for [Logan Simpson](https://logansimpson.com/). I am specialized in wetland delineation, biological surveys for ESA species, rare native plant surveys, and NEPA reporting. I am well versed in GIS software and hardware technology, and have a passion for computer science.

My motto throughout my education and experience thus far is that there is always something new to learn, and when an opportunity to explore comes along -take It!
